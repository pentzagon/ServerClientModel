# ServerClientModel
A client/server model in Python

ToDo list:
* Create setup file that pip installs all packages if any non-standard libraries are used.
* Create config file with dictionary (or class)
* Flesh out server comments
* Write unit tests (required) (file for each of client and server unit tests??)
* Test client
* Test client closing early (logging, handling)
* Lint all files.
